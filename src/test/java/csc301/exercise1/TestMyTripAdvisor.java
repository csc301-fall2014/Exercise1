	 * You can use the starter code as an example of how to write tests
	 * a bit more efficiently, and cleanly. 
	 * You don't have to use our technique, we are just suggesting something that
	 * you might find it useful.
	 * 
	 * Here's a description of what we do:
	 * 1. We store a train-company's data in a text file.
	 * 2. Before each test, we load all of the data from the files to local variables.
	 *    Note: This is inefficient, and would be an issue in a project that has many 
	 *    tests and data files. For this exercise, we chose to not worry about this issue.
	 * 
	 * Technical notes:
	 * - All data files are stored in src/test/resources.
	 *   This is important! If you data files are not stored with the project, we will
	 *   not be able to use them, when running your tests.
	 * - We've defined some utility classes in src/test/java/csc301/exercise1/util.
	 *   Feel free to add/modify code in these classes.
	 * - You might find it useful to come up with a few more utility functions that
	 *   will help you write cleaner tests.
	 *
